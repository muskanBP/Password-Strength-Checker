## Features

1. **Password Strength Meter**:
   - Evaluates the strength of a password based on:
     - Length (minimum 8 characters, recommended 12+).
     - Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
     - Inclusion of digits (0-9).
     - Use of special characters (!@#$%^&*).

2. **Password Generator**:
   - Generates strong, secure passwords with:
     - Fixed length of 12 characters.
     - Option to include/exclude special characters.
   - Allows users to automatically use the generated password.

3. **Weak Password Blacklist**:

   - Displays a list of weak passwords to avoid.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Built using Streamlit for a clean and intuitive GUI.
   - Real-time progress bar to visualize password strength.
